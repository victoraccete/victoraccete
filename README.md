#### About me
My name is Victor Accete and I'm a brazilian Computer Engineering undergraduate. During my graduation I found out that I love working with data, since I'm a curious individual.

I'm currently working as an Undergraduate Student Researcher on Kinship Recognition with RGBD images. 

I enjoy programming for solving problems and discovering things. I'm shaerpening my skills with Python, specially Pandas, Numpy and visualization libraries such as Seaborn, Plotly and Matplotlib. I'm also currently making my first steps with Tensorflow, Computer Vision and Machine Learning. 

### Portfolio
Here are some projects I'm proud of and I want to show to you. Please note that this section is permanently under construction.  

**A bot to download government open data through filling forms with Selenium**  pt-br: [Here]('https://github.com/victoraccete/ICD_20182/tree/webScraper')  
This is the data collection part of a broader project. I wanted to download multiple excel spreadsheets from SISVAN website. I automated this process with Python requests and Selenium. 

**Data cleaning and visualization with government open data with Python**  pt-br: [Here]('https://github.com/victoraccete/ICD_20182')  
Cleaned and explored SISVAN (System of Alimentary and Nutritional Vigilance) data and developed static and interactive plots using Pandas, geopandas, Plotly and Bokeh. The main notebook can be found [here]('https://github.com/victoraccete/ICD_20182/blob/master/map_plot.ipynb')

**Pneumonia detection from x-ray chest images with CNNs**  English: [Here]('https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1J3wTArG8H1dClS7VsgbUCzmboD_BaUdZ?usp=sharing')  
This notebook has educational purposes only. This time, I tried to be didatic so it could also be helpful to someone else and wrote down my thought process throughout the notebook. I experimented the benefits of using Data Augmentation to reduce overfitting.
