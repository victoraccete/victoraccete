### Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹

### About me
My name is Victor Accete and I'm a brazilian Computer Engineering undergraduate. During my graduation I found out that I love working with data, since I'm a curious individual.

I'm currently working as an Undergraduate Student Researcher on Kinship Recognition with RGBD images. 

I enjoy programming for solving problems and discovering things. I'm sharpening my skills with Python, specially Pandas, Numpy and visualization libraries such as Seaborn, Plotly and Matplotlib. I'm also currently making my first steps with Tensorflow, Computer Vision and Machine Learning. 

### Portfolio
Here are some projects I'm proud of and I want to show to you. Please note that this section is permanently under construction. Expect to see more data analysis and machine learning here soon! =) 

**Interactive data visualization of brazilian teams revenues from 2007 to 2019, made with Streamlit**  
The repository's readme.md has information in English about the files and what they do: [Here](https://github.com/victoraccete/brazilian-teams-revenues).  
You can check it online without any setup here on [Streamlit share](https://share.streamlit.io/victoraccete/brazilian-teams-revenues/main)! (Portuguese)  
For this project, I scraped data from Wikipedia, cleaned the data and generated a cleaner .csv file using Pandas. Then I worked with this data, manipulating it, to generate interactive visualizations.  

**A bot to download government open data through filling forms with Selenium**  
Portuguese: [Here](https://github.com/victoraccete/ICD_20182/tree/webScraper)  
This is the data collection part of a broader project. I wanted to download multiple excel spreadsheets from SISVAN website. I automated this process with Python requests and Selenium. 

**Data cleaning and visualization of government open data with Python**  
Portuguese: [Here](https://github.com/victoraccete/ICD_20182)  
Cleaned and explored SISVAN (System of Alimentary and Nutritional Vigilance) data and developed static and interactive plots using Pandas, geopandas, Plotly and Bokeh. The main notebook can be found [here]('https://github.com/victoraccete/ICD_20182/blob/master/map_plot.ipynb')

**Pneumonia detection from x-ray chest images with CNNs**  
English: [Here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1J3wTArG8H1dClS7VsgbUCzmboD_BaUdZ?usp=sharing)  
This notebook has educational purposes only. This time, I tried to be didatic so it could also be helpful to someone else and wrote down my thought process throughout the notebook. I experimented the benefits of using Data Augmentation to reduce overfitting. 

**Exploratory data analysis with public transport open data**  
Portuguese: [Here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/victoraccete/SMTT-EDA/blob/main/SMTT_EDA.ipynb)  
This notebook was made to evaluate public transport companies and travels from MaceiÃ³-AL. I developed some visualizations with Plotly, Seaborn and Matplotlib.
